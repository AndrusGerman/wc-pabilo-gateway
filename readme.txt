Accept mobile payments (Pago Móvil) and bank transfers from Venezuela (Banco de Venezuela, Mercantil, Banesco, Provincial) via Pabilo.

== Description ==

Pabilo Payment Gateway lets WooCommerce stores accept payments from major Venezuelan banks through a simple, verified flow.

This plugin connects your store to the [Pabilo](https://pabilo.app) payment service. When you configure your API key, you consent to sending order data (amount, description, order ID) to Pabilo to generate payment links and verify transactions. See [Pabilo Terms of Use](https://pabilo.app/terms) for data handling details.

Configure your API key, choose the bank account to receive funds, and start accepting:

* **Pago Móvil** (mobile payments)
* **Bank transfers**

Supported banks include Banco de Venezuela, Mercantil, Banesco, Provincial, and other banks supported by Pabilo.

The plugin creates one secure payment link per order and verifies payment automatically via webhooks (with API verification). If the customer goes back and clicks Pay again, the same link is reused instead of creating duplicates. If the order total changes (e.g. cart edited), the existing link is updated via Pabilo’s PATCH API so there is still only one link per order.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/pabilo-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce`, or install via the Plugins screen in WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins screen.
3. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Pabilo Payment Gateway to configure.
4. Enter your **API Key** from your Pabilo dashboard.
5. Select the bank account where you want to receive funds.
