WordPress.org submission note
============================

Slug restriction: The term "wc" is not allowed in the plugin slug on WordPress.org.

When you create the ZIP for submission, use a root folder name that does NOT contain "wc", for example:

  pabilo-payment-gateway

So the ZIP structure should be:

  pabilo-payment-gateway/
    pabilo-payment-gateway.php
    readme.txt
    readme-es.txt
    includes/
    assets/

(i.e. put the current plugin contents inside a folder named "pabilo-payment-gateway", not "pabilo-payment-gateway").

This way the directory slug will be "pabilo-payment-gateway" and will pass the guidelines.
